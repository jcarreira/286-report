\team{May be a good idea to push this to the beginning of the paper to show that not everything we are doing has been done before. Perhaps after motivation}

\paragraph {\bf Scheduling} Scheduling papers (policies, scalability, low-latency) go here~\cite{Sparrow}

%\paragraph {\bf Streaming} Streaming systems go here. A big portion of these are not low-latency. Those that are better have some limitation that Spark Streaming does not.

\paragraph {\bf Something more databases oriented, e.g., dataflows?}

\paragraph {\bf Approximate Query Engines} Past work \cite{BlinkDB, OnlineAggregation} has focused on providing answers within a desired confidence interval to reduce the computation time and achieve fast response times. Our techniques focus instead on reducing the overheads of analytics systems.
