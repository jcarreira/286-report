@techreport{Trill,
    Abstract = {<p>This technical report introduces Trill -- a new query processor for analytics.
        Trill fulfills a combination of three requirements for a query processor to serve
            the diverse big data analytics space: (1) Query Model: Trill is based on a
            tempo-relational model that enables it to handle streaming and relational queries
            with early results, across the latency spectrum from real-time to offline; (2)
            Fabric and Language Integration: Trill is architected as a high-level language
            library that supports rich data-types and user libraries, and integrates well
            with existing distribution fabrics and applications; and (3) Performance: Trill's
            throughput is high across the latency spectrum. For streaming data, Trill's
            throughput is 2-4 orders of magnitude higher than today's comparable streaming
            engines. For offline relational queries, Trill's throughput is comparable to a
            major modern commercial columnar DBMS.<br/>
            <br/>
            Trill uses a streaming
            batched-columnar data representation with a new dynamic compilation-based system
            architecture that addresses all these requirements. In this technical report, we
            describe Trill's new design and architecture, and report experimental results
            that demonstrate Trill's high performance across diverse analytics scenarios. We
            also describe how Trill's ability to support diverse analytics has resulted in
            its adoption across many usage scenarios at Microsoft.</p>},

@inproceedings{StreamInsight,
    Abstract = {<p>We present the Microsoft Complex Event Processing (CEP) Server, Microsoft CEP
        for short. Microsoft CEP is an event stream processing system featured by its
            declarative query language and its multiple consistency levels of stream query
                processing. Query composability, query fusing, and operator sharing are key
                features in the Microsoft CEP query processor. Moreover, the debugging and
                supportability tools of Microsoft CEP provide visibility of system internals to
                users.

                Web click analysis has been crucial to behavior-based online marketing.  Streams
                of web click events provide a typical workload for a CEP server. Meanwhile, a CEP
                server with its processing capabilities plays a key role in web click analysis.
                This demo highlights the features of Microsoft CEP under a workload of web click
                events.</p>},
